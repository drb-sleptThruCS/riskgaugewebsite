(Austin TX) – Today Risk Gauge announces it’s formation alongside a $1 million funding from PCG Capital to accelerate development for a ’22 second quarter launch. Risk Gauge is the first SaaS app focused on SMBs & MSPs that feeds data directly into your cyberinsurance plan, resulting in both better security and better coverage.

After working together for the past year in cyberinsurance, Reid Wellock (President of Fifthwall Solutions, a cyberinsurer) and Dustin Bolander (an MSP entrepreneur) realized there was ample opportunity to improve the process. As Risk Gauge nears completion, Wes Spencer, formerly of Perch & Connectwise, joins the team as President to help guide the vision.
<i>quote from Wes about seeing the leadership of insurance for the industry</i>
As MSPs and their clients have struggled with cyberinsurance, Risk Gauge is partnering with Fifthwall Insurance to help procure better policies for MSPs and their clients. Fifthwall has spent the last year designing an insurance program specifically to help MSPs get better coverage for both themselves and their clients, while educating MSPs how insurance can be an ally to their cybersecurity efforts. With 35 MSPs already enrolled, the full program launches in April alongside Risk Gauge.
